This project is the implementation of multiple machine learning classification techniques to predict whether a customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it.
Here's how I approached solving this problem:

* Data Collection: Gather historical data on hotel reservations, including information such as booking date, check-in date, cancellation date (if applicable), length of stay, room type, customer demographics, and any other relevant features.

Kaggle made this step easy for me and the data was available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset 

* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.
  used pandas and numpy here.

* Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones that may be informative for predicting cancellations
  
* Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for classification,
  I implemented models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K nearest neighbours.

* Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data, tuning hyperparameters as needed.

* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score to assess their performance.
  I used accuracy as the key metric and compared among them, most of their accuracy lied around 80%
  
* Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model into production to make real-time predictions on new hotel reservations.
  model can be deployed, but to improve the accuracy we can implement neural networks (Deep Learning techniques) which will find the patterns better than these shallow learning algorithms, but I made this project to compare shallow learning algorithms in classifiaction task.

* The business problem is addressed !
This can help hoteliers optimize their revenue management strategies, allocate resources more efficiently, and minimize the impact of cancellations on their business.
